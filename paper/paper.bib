  abstract = {A nonlinear black-box structure for a dynamical
                   system is a model structure that is prepared to
                   describe virtually any nonlinear dynamics. There has
                   been considerable recent interest in this area, with
                   structures based on neural networks, radial basis
                   networks, wavelet networks and hinging hyperplanes,
                   as well as wavelet-transform-based methods and models
                   based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules. This paper
                   describes all these approaches in a common framework,
                   from a user's perspective. It focuses on what are the
                   common features in the different approaches, the
                   choices that have to be made and what considerations
                   are relevant for a successful system-identification
                   application of these techniques. It is pointed out
                   that the nonlinear structures can be seen as a
                   concatenation of a mapping form observed data to a
                   regression vector and a nonlinear mapping from the
                   regressor space to the output space. These mappings
                   are discussed separately. The latter mapping is
                   usually formed as a basis function expansion. The
                   basis functions are typically formed from one simple
                   scalar function, which is modified in terms of scale
                   and location. The expansion from the scalar argument
                   to the regressor space is achieved by a radial- or a
                   ridge-type approach. Basic techniques for estimating
                   the parameters in the structures are criterion
                   minimization, as well as two-step procedures, where
                   first the relevant basis functions are determined,
                   using data, and then a linear least-squares step to
                   determine the coordinates of the function
                   approximation. A particular problem is to deal with
                   the large number of potentially necessary parameters.
                   This is handled by making the number of ‘used’
                   parameters considerably less than the number of
                   ‘offered’ parameters, by regularization,
                   shrinking, pruning or regressor selection.},

                   a central theme in machine learning. In the last few
                   years, many algorithms have been developed that
                   exploit Tikhonov regularization theory and
                   reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. These are the
                   so-called kernel-based methods, which include
                   powerful approaches like regularization networks,
                   support vector machines, and Gaussian regression.
                   Recently, these techniques have also gained
                   popularity in the system identification community. In
                   both linear and nonlinear settings, kernels that
                   incorporate information on dynamic systems, such as
                   the smoothness and stability of the input–output
                   map, can challenge consolidated approaches based on
                   parametric model structures. In the classical
                   parametric setting, the complexity of the model (the
                   model order) needs to be chosen, typically from a
                   finite family of alternatives, by trading bias and
                   variance. This (discrete) model order selection step
                   may be critical, especially when the true model does
                   not belong to the model class. In
                   regularization-based approaches, model complexity is
                   controlled by tuning (continuous) regularization
                   parameters, making the model selection step more
                   robust. In this article, we review these new
                   kernel-based system identification approaches and
                   discuss extensions based on nuclear and norms.},

  abstract =      {The identification of non-linear systems using only
                   observed finite datasets has become a mature research
                   area over the last two decades. A class of
                   linear-in-the-parameter models with universal
                   approximation capabilities have been intensively
                   studied and widely used due to the availability of
                   many linear-learning algorithms and their inherent
                   convergence conditions. This article presents a
                   systematic overview of basic research on model
                   selection approaches for linear-in-the-parameter
                   models. One of the fundamental problems in non-linear
                   system identification is to find the minimal model
                   with the best model generalisation performance from
                   observational data only. The important concepts in
                   achieving good model generalisation used in various
                   non-linear system-identification algorithms are first
                   reviewed, including Bayesian parameter regularisation
                   and models selective criteria based on the cross
                   validation and experimental design. A significant
                   advance in machine learning has been the development
                   of the support vector machine as a means for
                   identifying kernel models based on the structural
                   risk minimisation principle. The developments on the
                   convex optimisation-based model construction
                   algorithms including the support vector regression
                   algorithms are outlined. Input selection algorithms
                   and on-line system identification algorithms are also
                   included in this review. Finally, some industrial
                   applications of non-linear models are discussed.},

                   strongly nonlinear dynamics approximately linear has
                   the potential to enable nonlinear prediction,
                   estimation, and control using linear theory. The
                   Koopman operator is a leading data-driven embedding,
                   and its eigenfunctions provide intrinsic coordinates
                   that globally linearize the dynamics. However,
                   identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has
                   proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning
                   to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions
                   from data. Our network is parsimonious and
                   interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics
                   on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear
                   coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear
                   using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize
                   Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class
                   of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework
                   parametrizes the continuous frequency using an
                   auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient
                   embedding, while connecting our models to decades of
                   asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep
                   learning, while retaining the physical
                   interpretability of Koopman embeddings.},

  abstract =      {This article reviews theory and applications of
                   Koopman modes in fluid mechanics. Koopman mode
                   decomposition is based on the surprising fact,
                   discovered in Mezić (2005), that normal modes of
                   linear oscillations have their natural
                   analogs—Koopman modes—in the context of nonlinear
                   dynamics. To pursue this analogy, one must change the
                   representation of the system from the state-space
                   representation to the dynamics governed by the linear
                   Koopman operator on an infinite-dimensional space of
                   observables. Whereas Koopman in his original paper
                   dealt only with measure-preserving transformations,
                   the discussion here is predominantly on dissipative
                   systems arising from Navier-Stokes evolution. The
                   analysis is based on spectral properties of the
                   Koopman operator. Aspects of point and continuous
                   parts of the spectrum are discussed. The point
                   spectrum corresponds to isolated frequencies of
                   oscillation present in the fluid flow, and also to
                   growth rates of stable and unstable modes. The
                   continuous part of the spectrum corresponds to
                   chaotic motion on the attractor. A method of
                   computation of the spectrum and the associated
                   Koopman modes is discussed in terms of generalized
                   Laplace analysis. When applied to a generic
                   observable, this method uncovers the full point
                   spectrum. A computational alternative is given by
                   Arnoldi-type methods, leading to so-called dynamic
                   mode decomposition, and I discuss the connection and
                   differences between these two methods. A number of
                   applications are reviewed in which decompositions of
                   this type have been pursued. Koopman mode theory
                   unifies and provides a rigorous background for a
                   number of different concepts that have been advanced
                   in fluid mechanics, including global mode analysis,
                   triple decomposition, and dynamic mode
                   decomposition.},

                   quickly solvable reduced order model  of
                   parametrized partial differential equation problems.
                   With speedups that can reach several orders of
                   magnitude, reduced basis methods enable high fidelity
                   real-time simulations of complex systems and

                   analyze the methodology, mainly focussing on the
                   theoretical aspects of the approach. In particular we
                   discuss what is known about the convergence
                   properties of these methods: when they succeed and
                   when they are bound to fail. Moreover, we highlight
                   some recent approaches employing nonlinear

  abstract =      {Nearly all model-reduction techniques project the
                   governing equations onto a linear subspace of the
                   original state space. Such subspaces are typically
                   computed using methods such as balanced truncation,
                   rational interpolation, the reduced-basis method, and
                   (balanced) proper orthogonal decomposition (POD).
                   Unfortunately, restricting the state to evolve in a
                   linear subspace imposes a fundamental limitation to
                   the accuracy of the resulting reduced-order model
                   (ROM). In particular, linear-subspace ROMs can be
                   expected to produce low-dimensional models with high
                   accuracy only if the problem admits a fast decaying
                   Kolmogorov n-width (e.g., diffusion-dominated
                   problems). Unfortunately, many problems of interest
                   exhibit a slowly decaying Kolmogorov n-width (e.g.,
                   advection-dominated problems). To address this, we
                   propose a novel framework for projecting dynamical
                   systems onto nonlinear manifolds using
                   minimum-residual formulations at the time-continuous
                   and time-discrete levels; the former leads to
                   manifold Galerkin projection, while the latter leads
                   to manifold least-squares Petrov–Galerkin (LSPG)
                   projection. We perform analyses that provide insight
                   into the relationship between these proposed
                   approaches and classical linear-subspace
                   reduced-order models; we also derive a posteriori
                   discrete-time error bounds for the proposed
                   approaches. In addition, we propose a computationally
                   practical approach for computing the nonlinear
                   manifold, which is based on convolutional
                   autoencoders from deep learning. Finally, we
                   demonstrate the ability of the method to
                   significantly outperform even the optimal
                   linear-subspace ROM on benchmark advection-dominated
                   problems, thereby demonstrating the method's ability

  abstract =      {While there is currently a lot of enthusiasm about
                   âbig dataâ, useful data is usually
                   âsmallâ and expensive to acquire. In this
                   paper, we present a new paradigm of learning partial
                   differential equations from small data. In
                   particular, we introduce hidden physics models, which
                   are essentially data-efficient learning machines
                   capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics,
                   expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial
                   differential equations, to extract patterns from
                   high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The
                   proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of
                   learning, system identification, or data-driven
                   discovery of partial differential equations. Our
                   framework relies on Gaussian processes, a powerful
                   tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that
                   enables us to strike a balance between model
                   complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the
                   proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety
                   of canonical problems, spanning a number of
                   scientific domains, including the NavierâStokes,
                   SchrÃ¶dinger, KuramotoâSivashinsky, and time
                   dependent linear fractional equations. The
                   methodology provides a promising new direction for
                   harnessing the long-standing developments of
                   classical methods in applied mathematics and
                   mathematical physics to design learning machines with
                   the ability to operate in complex domains without
                   requiring large quantities of data.},

                   the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation

                   problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free
                   regulator problem. The new method developed here is
                   applied to two well-known problems, confirming and
                   extending earlier results. The discussion is largely
                   self-contained and proceeds from first principles;

                   is to prove the convergences to the optimal filter of
                   such approximations, yielding what seemed to be the

                   for such approximations of the nonlinear filtering
                   equations. This new treatment was influenced
                   primarily by the development of genetic algorithms
                   (see [16] and [3]), and secondarily by the papers of

                   a bank of unscented filters to obtain the importance
                   proposal distribution. This proposal has two very
                   "nice" properties. Firstly, it makes efficient use of
                   the latest available information and, secondly, it
                   can have heavy tails. As a result, we find that the

                   other nonlinear filtering methods very substantially.
                   This experimental finding is in agreement with the
                   theoretical convergence proof for the algorithm. The

                   low-dimensional descriptions that capture much of the
                   phenomena of interest. The discrete version of the
                   POD, which is the singular value decomposition (SVD)
                   of matrices, is described in some detail. The

  abstract = {Starting from measured data, we develop a method to
                   compute the fine structure of the spectrum of the
                   Koopman operator with rigorous convergence
                   guarantees. The method is based on the observation
                   that, in the measure-preserving ergodic setting, the
                   moments of the spectral measure associated to a given
                   observable are computable from a single trajectory of
                   this observable. Having finitely many moments
                   available, we use the classical Christoffel–Darboux
                   kernel to separate the atomic and absolutely
                   continuous parts of the spectrum, supported by
                   convergence guarantees as the number of moments tends
                   to infinity. In addition, we propose a technique to
                   detect the singular continuous part of the spectrum
                   as well as two methods to approximate the spectral
                   measure with guaranteed convergence in the weak
                   topology, irrespective of whether the singular
                   continuous part is present or not. The proposed
                   method is simple to implement and readily applicable
                   to large-scale systems since the computational
                   complexity is dominated by inverting an N×N
                   Hermitian positive-definite Toeplitz matrix, where N
                   is the number of moments, for which efficient and
                   numerically stable algorithms exist; in particular,
                   the complexity of the approach is independent of the
                   dimension of the underlying state-space. We also show
                   how to compute, from measured data, the spectral
                   projection on a given segment of the unit circle,
                   allowing us to obtain a finite approximation of the
                   operator that explicitly takes into account the point
                   and continuous parts of the spectrum. Finally, we
                   describe a relationship between the proposed method
                   and the so-called Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition,
                   providing new insights into the behavior of the
                   eigenvalues of the Hankel DMD operator. A number of
                   numerical examples illustrate the approach, including
                   a study of the spectrum of the lid-driven
                   two-dimensional cavity flow.},

                   Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm is derived to
                   compute these ML estimates. The Expectation (E) step
                   involves solving a nonlinear state estimation
                   problem, where the smoothed estimates of the states
                   are required. This problem lends itself perfectly to
                   the particle smoother, which provides arbitrarily
                   good estimates. The maximisation (M) step is solved
                   using standard techniques from numerical optimisation
                   theory. Simulation examples demonstrate the efficacy
                   of our proposed solution.},

  abstract =      {Latent variable models (LVMs) are powerful tools for
                   discovering hidden structure in data. Canonical LVMs
                   include factor analysis, which explains the
                   correlation of a large number of observed variables
                   in terms of a smaller number of unobserved ones, and
                   Gaussian mixture models, which reveal clusters of
                   data arising from an underlying multimodal
                   distribution. In this paper, we describe a
                   conceptually simple and equally effective LVM for
                   nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR), where the
                   goal is to discover faithful, neighborhood-preserving
                   embeddings of high-dimensional data. Tools for NLDR
                   can help researchers across all areas of science and
                   engineering to better understand and visualize their
                   data. Our approach elevates NLDR into the family of
                   problems that can be studied by especially tractable
                   LVMs.We propose a latent variable model to discover
                   faithful low-dimensional representations of
                   high-dimensional data. The model computes a
                   low-dimensional embedding that aims to preserve
                   neighborhood relationships encoded by a sparse graph.
                   The model both leverages and extends current leading
                   approaches to this problem. Like t-distributed
                   Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding, the model can
                   produce two- and three-dimensional embeddings for
                   visualization, but it can also learn
                   higher-dimensional embeddings for other uses. Like
                   LargeVis and Uniform Manifold Approximation and
                   Projection, the model produces embeddings by
                   balancing two goals{\textemdash}pulling nearby
                   examples closer together and pushing distant examples
                   further apart. Unlike these approaches, however, the
                   latent variables in our model provide additional
                   structure that can be exploited for learning. We
                   derive an Expectation{\textendash}Maximization
                   procedure with closed-form updates that monotonically
                   improve the model{\textquoteright}s likelihood: In
                   this procedure, embeddings are iteratively adapted by
                   solving sparse, diagonally dominant systems of linear
                   equations that arise from a discrete graph Laplacian.
                   For large problems, we also develop an approximate
                   coarse-graining procedure that avoids the need for
                   negative sampling of nonadjacent nodes in the graph.
                   We demonstrate the model{\textquoteright}s
                   effectiveness on datasets of images and text.},

                   decades as generative models of sequential data. They
                   admit an intuitive probabilistic interpretation, have
                   a simple functional form, and enjoy widespread
                   adoption. We introduce a unified algorithm to
                   efficiently learn a broad class of linear and
                   non-linear state space models, including variants
                   where the emission and transition distributions are
                   modeled by deep neural networks. Our learning
                   algorithm simultaneously learns a compiled inference
                   network and the generative model, leveraging a
                   structured variational approximation parameterized by
                   recurrent neural networks to mimic the posterior
                   distribution. We apply the learning algorithm to both
                   synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its
                   scalability and versatility. We find that using the

                   error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991)
                   analysis of this problem, then address it by
                   introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method
                   called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the
                   gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn
                   to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000
                   discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow
                   through constant error carousels within special
                   units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and

  abstract =      {Governing equations are essential to the study of
                   physical systems, providing models that can
                   generalize to predict previously unseen behaviors.
                   There are many systems of interest across disciplines
                   where large quantities of data have been collected,
                   but the underlying governing equations remain
                   unknown. This work introduces an approach to discover
                   governing models from data. The proposed method
                   addresses a key limitation of prior approaches by
                   simultaneously discovering coordinates that admit a
                   parsimonious dynamical model. Developing parsimonious
                   and interpretable governing models has the potential
                   to transform our understanding of complex systems,
                   including in neuroscience, biology, and climate
                   science.The discovery of governing equations from
                   scientific data has the potential to transform
                   data-rich fields that lack well-characterized
                   quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse
                   regression are currently enabling the tractable
                   identification of both the structure and parameters
                   of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The
                   resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to
                   describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity
                   with descriptive ability, and thus promoting
                   interpretability and generalizability. This provides
                   an algorithmic approach to Occam{\textquoteright}s
                   razor for model discovery. However, this approach
                   fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate
                   system in which the dynamics have a simple
                   representation. In this work, we design a custom deep
                   autoencoder network to discover a coordinate
                   transformation into a reduced space where the
                   dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we
                   simultaneously learn the governing equations and the
                   associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this
                   approach on several example high-dimensional systems
                   with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling
                   framework combines the strengths of deep neural
                   networks for flexible representation and sparse
                   identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for
                   parsimonious models. This method places the discovery
                   of coordinates and models on an equal footing.},

                   modeling the error incurred by approximate solutions
                   to parameterized dynamical systems. In particular, we
                   extend the machine-learning error models (MLEM)
                   framework proposed in Ref. Freno and Carlberg (2019)
                   to dynamical systems. The proposed Time-Series
                   Machine-Learning Error Modeling (T-MLEM) method
                   constructs a regression model that maps features –
                   which comprise error indicators that are derived from
                   standard a posteriori error-quantification techniques
                   – to a random variable for the approximate-solution
                   error at each time instance. The proposed framework
                   considers a wide range of candidate features,
                   regression methods, and additive noise models. We
                   consider primarily recursive regression techniques
                   developed for time-series modeling, including both
                   classical time-series models (e.g., autoregressive
                   models) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), but
                   also analyze standard non-recursive regression
                   techniques (e.g., feed-forward neural networks) for
                   comparative purposes. Numerical experiments conducted
                   on multiple benchmark problems illustrate that the
                   long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, which
                   is a type of RNN, outperforms other methods and
                   yields substantial improvements in error predictions
                   over traditional approaches.},

                   arise in many science and engineering applications.
                   For regular grids, Convolutional Neural Networks
                   (CNNs) gain benefits from weight sharing and
                   invariances. We generalize CNNs by introducing
                   methods for data on unstructured point clouds using
                   Generalized Moving Least Squares (GMLS). GMLS is a
                   nonparametric meshfree technique for estimating
                   linear bounded functionals from scattered data, and
                   has emerged as an effective technique for solving
                   partial differential equations (PDEs). By
                   parameterizing the GMLS estimator, we obtain learning
                   methods for linear and non-linear operators with
                   unstructured stencils. The requisite calculations are
                   local, embarrassingly parallelizable, and supported
                   by a rigorous approximation theory. We show how the
                   framework may be used for unstructured physical data
                   sets to perform operator regression, develop
                   predictive dynamical models, and obtain feature
                   extractors for engineering quantities of interest.
                   The results show the promise of these architectures
                   as foundations for data-driven model development in
                   scientific machine learning applications.},

                   low dimensional, interpretable, latent state of a
                   video containing a moving object. The problem of
                   distilling interpretable dynamics from pixels has
                   been extensively considered through the lens of
                   graphical/state space models (Fraccaro et al., 2017;
                   Lin et al., 2018; Pearce et al., 2018; Chiappa and
                   Paquet, 2019) that exploit Markov structure for cheap
                   computation and structured priors for enforcing
                   interpretability on latent representations. We take a
                   step towards extending these approaches by discarding
                   the Markov structure; inspired by Gaussian process
                   dynamical models (Wang et al., 2006), we instead
                   repurpose the recently proposed Gaussian Process
                   Prior Variational Autoencoder (Casale et al., 2018)
                   for learning interpretable latent dynamics. We
                   describe the model and perform experiments on a
                   synthetic dataset and see that the model reliably
                   reconstructs smooth dynamics exhibiting U-turns and
                   loops. We also observe that this model may be trained
                   without any annealing or freeze-thaw of training
                   parameters in contrast to previous works, albeit for
                   slightly dierent use cases, where application specic
                   training tricks are often required.},

  abstract =      {Measuring the similarity between data points often
                   requires domain knowledge, which can in parts be
                   compensated by relying on unsupervised methods such
                   as latent-variable models, where similarity/distance
                   is estimated in a more compact latent space.
                   Prevalent is the use of the Euclidean metric, which
                   has the drawback of ignoring information about
                   similarity of data stored in the decoder, as captured
                   by the framework of Riemannian geometry. We propose
                   an extension to the framework of variational
                   auto-encoders allows learning flat latent manifolds,
                   where the Euclidean metric is a proxy for the
                   similarity between data points. This is achieved by
                   defining the latent space as a Riemannian manifold
                   and by regularising the metric tensor to be a scaled
                   identity matrix. Additionally, we replace the compact
                   prior typically used in variational auto-encoders
                   with a recently presented, more expressive
                   hierarchical one—and formulate the learning problem
                   as a constrained optimisation problem. We evaluate
                   our method on a range of data-sets, including a
                   video-tracking benchmark, where the performance of
                   our unsupervised approach nears that of
                   state-of-the-art supervised approaches, while
                   retaining the computational efficiency of
                   straight-line-based approaches.},

                   representation of distributions around

                   More specifically, we show that most $$n\times
                   n$$n×npatches from a given image can be projected
                   onto $$\fancyscript{K}$$Kyielding a finite sample

                   terms of Fourier-like coefficients, which in turn,
                   can be estimated from $$S$$S. We show that image
                   rotation acts as a linear transformation at the level
                   of the estimated coefficients, and use this to define
                   a multi-scale rotation-invariant descriptor. We test

  abstract =      {Estimating the pose of a human in 3D given an image
                   or a video has recently received significant
                   attention from the scientific community. The main
                   reasons for this trend are the ever increasing new
                   range of applications (e.g., human-robot interaction,
                   gaming, sports performance analysis) which are driven
                   by current technological advances. Although recent
                   approaches have dealt with several challenges and
                   have reported remarkable results, 3D pose estimation
                   remains a largely unsolved problem because real-life
                   applications impose several challenges which are not
                   fully addressed by existing methods. For example,
                   estimating the 3D pose of multiple people in an
                   outdoor environment remains a largely unsolved
                   problem. In this paper, we review the recent advances
                   in 3D human pose estimation from RGB images or image
                   sequences. We propose a taxonomy of the approaches
                   based on the input (e.g., single image or video,
                   monocular or multi-view) and in each case we
                   categorize the methods according to their key
                   characteristics. To provide an overview of the
                   current capabilities, we conducted an extensive
                   experimental evaluation of state-of-the-art
                   approaches in a synthetic dataset created
                   specifically for this task, which along with its
                   ground truth is made publicly available for research
                   purposes. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion
                   of the insights obtained from reviewing the
                   literature and the results of our experiments. Future
                   directions and challenges are identified.},

  abstract =      {Experimental data are often affected by uncontrolled
                   variables that make analysis and interpretation
                   difficult. For spatiotemporal systems, this problem
                   is further exacerbated by their intricate dynamics.
                   Modern machine learning methods are particularly well
                   suited for analyzing and modeling complex datasets,
                   but to be effective in science, the result needs to
                   be interpretable. We demonstrate an unsupervised
                   learning technique for extracting interpretable
                   physical parameters from noisy spatiotemporal data
                   and for building a transferable model of the system.
                   In particular, we implement a physics-informed
                   architecture based on variational autoencoders that
                   is designed for analyzing systems governed by partial
                   differential equations. The architecture is trained
                   end to end and extracts latent parameters that
                   parametrize the dynamics of a learned predictive
                   model for the system. To test our method, we train
                   our model on simulated data from a variety of partial
                   differential equations with varying dynamical
                   parameters that act as uncontrolled variables.
                   Numerical experiments show that our method can
                   accurately identify relevant parameters and extract
                   them from raw and even noisy spatiotemporal data
                   (tested with roughly $10\%$ added noise). These
                   extracted parameters correlate well (linearly with
                   $R^2 > 0.95$) with the ground truth physical
                   parameters used to generate the datasets. We then
                   apply this method to nonlinear fiber propagation
                   data, generated by an ab initio simulation, to
                   demonstrate its capabilities on a more realistic
                   dataset. Our method for discovering interpretable
                   latent parameters in spatiotemporal systems will
                   allow us to better analyze and understand real-world
                   phenomena and datasets, which often have unknown and
                   uncontrolled variables that alter the system dynamics
                   and cause varying behaviors that are difficult to
                   disentangle.},

                   Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of
                   Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine
                   learning that enables computers to learn from
                   experience and understand the world in terms of a
                   hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers
                   knowledge from experience, there is no need for a
                   human computer operator to formally specify all the
                   knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of
                   concepts allows the computer to learn complicated
                   concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a
                   graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep.
                   This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep
                   learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual
                   background, covering relevant concepts in linear
                   algebra, probability theory and information theory,
                   numerical computation, and machine learning. It
                   describes deep learning techniques used by
                   practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward
                   networks, regularization, optimization algorithms,
                   convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and
                   practical methodology; and it surveys such
                   applications as natural language processing, speech
                   recognition, computer vision, online recommendation
                   systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the
                   book offers research perspectives, covering such
                   theoretical topics as linear factor models,
                   autoencoders, representation learning, structured
                   probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the
                   partition function, approximate inference, and deep
                   generative models. Deep Learning can be used by
                   undergraduate or graduate students planning careers
                   in either industry or research, and by software

                   With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven
                   discovery of dynamics will continue to play an
                   important role in these efforts.Extracting governing
                   equations from data is a central challenge in many
                   diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are
                   abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in
                   climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and
                   epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this
                   work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and
                   machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to
                   discover governing equations from noisy measurement
                   data. The only assumption about the structure of the
                   model is that there are only a few important terms
                   that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are
                   sparse in the space of possible functions; this
                   assumption holds for many physical systems in an
                   appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse
                   regression to determine the fewest terms in the
                   dynamic governing equations required to accurately
                   represent the data. This results in parsimonious
                   models that balance accuracy with model complexity to
                   avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a
                   wide range of problems, from simple canonical
                   systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators
                   and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex
                   shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example
                   illustrates the ability of this method to discover
                   the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts
                   in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also
                   show that this method generalizes to parameterized
                   systems and systems that are time-varying or have
                   external forcing.},

  abstract  = {One of the core problems of modern statistics
                   is to approximate difficult-to-compute probability
                   densities. This problem is especially important in
                   Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about
                   unknown quantities as a calculation involving the
                   posterior density. In this article, we review
                   variational inference (VI), a method from machine
                   learning that approximates probability densities
                   through optimization. VI has been used in many
                   applications and tends to be faster than classical
                   methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.
                   The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of
                   densities and then to find a member of that family
                   which is close to the target density. Closeness is
                   measured by Kullback–Leibler divergence. We review
                   the ideas behind mean-field variational inference,
                   discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential
                   family models, present a full example with a Bayesian
                   mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses
                   stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data.
                   We discuss modern research in VI and highlight
                   important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is
                   not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this
                   article is to catalyze statistical research on this
                   class of algorithms. Supplementary materials for this
                   article are available online.},
